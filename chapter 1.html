    <div><pre><b>Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word "computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through input device, process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied by the user, store it before and after processing of require and produce a meaningful information as an output through an output device. Generally, computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. The basic operation of computer is illustrated by following block diagram.</b>


        <h2>Some characteristics/features of computer.</h2>
        1.The implementation of computers are not only limited/confined to a small area rather they are used from simple domestic task to complex scientific research to engineering. The use of computer are increasing day-by-day due to some special features or characteristics that computer own. Several features of computer are:
        
        2.Accuracy: Computer are the accurate machine that means result produced by computer are 100% accurate. Since, it follows GIGO. The error that may arise in output is due to human not by a computer.

        3.Speed: Computer works on tremendously high speed. The operating speed of computer are measured in  millisecond, microsecond, picosecond and nanosecond which means computer can perform millions and billions of instruction per second.

        4.Storage: It is the area or unit which is capable of storing data and information for present and future use. Storing data allows users to retrieve it whenever required. These days computer comes with high volume of memory which are measured in Megabyte (1024 KB) , Gigabyte (1024 MB), Terabyte(1024 GB) and Petabyte(1024 TB).

        5.Versatility: Computer are generally design to serve more than one type of work. The implementation of computer are not only limited to specific purpose, they solve general requirement of the user and can be used in more than 1 type of job.

        6.Diligence: The feature of computer in which computer doesn't get tired even after working for long period of time. Computer can perform any number of task continuously until it is accomplished. Once the instruction is given computer follows the command till it gets terminated.

        7.Automatic: Computer is an automatic machine. Once the instruction is generated it perform accordingly until command is terminated. We don't have to issue continuous command in order to operate the computer. This is called automatic.</pre>
